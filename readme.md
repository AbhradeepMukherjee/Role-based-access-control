# Project Title: 
Role-Based Access Control

## Objective:
Design and implement a secure system that ensures proper user authentication, assigns roles to authenticated users, and enforces access control based on these roles. The system should demonstrate a robust understanding and practical application of Authentication, Authorization, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) principles to prevent unauthorized access and maintain data integrity.
